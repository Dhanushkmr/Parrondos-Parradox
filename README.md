# Parrondos-Parradox

This repo contains code for the 3 most popular Parrondo's games: Capital-dependent, History-Dependent and Cooperative Games. The aim of our research was so understand
how robust the Parrondo's games are to various kinds of signal noise. We tested on White, Pink and Brown Noise and noted the effects. We also used Markov chains to 
understand the effects of noises. 

The code executes the monte-carlo simulation in a parallel. Adjsut the number of CPUs you would like to use according to the specs of your machine.
